You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:
Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
Sample Input

/*
Enter your query here.
*/
 
select
    BST.N
    ,case
        when BST.P is null then 'Root'
        when not exists (select 1 from BST as BST_Search where BST.N = BST_Search.P) then 'Leaf'
        else 'Inner'
    end as NodeType
from BST
order by N

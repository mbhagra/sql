You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:
Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
Sample Input

/*
Enter your query here.
*/
 
select n, case when p is null then "Root"select
               when n not in (select distinct p from bst) then "leaf"    
               else "inner"        
           end case
from BST
order by n
